/**
 * url-key.mjs — canonical posting-URL key for deterministic tracker dedup.
 *
 * Two URLs that point to the same job posting must produce the same key so the
 * merge can upsert on it (the stable natural key — see merge-tracker.mjs Pass 0).
 *
 * UNDER-STRIP ON PURPOSE. The two failure modes are asymmetric:
 *   - over-normalizing collapses two genuinely different postings into one key
 *     → a SILENT merge / data loss (the exact bug this whole change fixes);
 *   - under-normalizing leaves two spellings of the SAME posting as two keys
 *     → a VISIBLE duplicate row you can see and fix.
 * So we strip only a denylist of known tracking params, lowercase the host,
 * force https, drop non-identity fragments + a trailing slash, and sort the
 * remaining query — and KEEP every functional query param (e.g. gh_jid, which
 * on some corporate-hosted Greenhouse boards is the canonical posting id).
 *
 * This mirrors RFC 3986 §6, whose comparison ladder runs simple-string →
 * syntax-based → scheme-based → protocol-based, and whose stated design goal is
 * to "minimize false negatives while strictly avoiding false positives" — the
 * same asymmetry above. Case and trailing-dot-segment handling are §6.2.2
 * syntax-based normalization and are always safe. Dropping query parameters is
 * NOT: the RFC puts scheme/protocol-specific knowledge on a higher rung that
 * requires knowing the resource. So the denylist stays narrow and literal, and
 * generic names (ref, source, src) are deliberately NOT stripped — they are
 * functional on some boards, and stripping them would merge two distinct
 * postings, which is the failure direction the RFC tells us to avoid.
 *
 * NO KEY IS NOT A KEY. An input that is not a usable http(s) posting URL
 * returns '' — never a lowercased-string stand-in. A placeholder like "N/A" or
 * "TBD" is a sentinel for a MISSING value, and SQL's three-valued logic is the
 * settled answer here: NULL is never equal to NULL, and a comparison against it
 * is UNKNOWN rather than true. Returning s.toLowerCase() gave every "N/A" row
 * one shared key, so unrelated employers compared equal on it.
 *
 * Used by merge-tracker.mjs. Kept in its own module so scan.mjs / scan-history
 * can adopt the same key later without the definitions drifting.

// list literal and conservative, for the same reason TRACKING_PARAMS is. Adding
// an employer-controlled host here would let a fuzzy title collision merge two
// genuinely distinct requisitions, which is the silent failure direction.
// The scraper list is shared with scan.mjs (data-static/aggregator-domains.txt,
// #4263) so a newly discovered reposter is added in ONE place.
//
// It does not answer this module's question on its own. That file lists hosts
// that SCRAPE AND REPOST, and deliberately omits the big job boards because
// companies post to them directly as a primary board — its header says exactly
// that about indeed.com. url-key.mjs asks something broader: is this URL
// EMPLOYER-CONTROLLED? For a board that carries a company's own posting under
// its own URL the answer is still no, because the same requisition also lives
// on the employer's ATS, which is the duplicate this module exists to collapse.
//
// So the shared file is the base and these are layered on top, each named with
// the reason it is absent there. Dropping any of them would silently un-fix the
// case this whole change is for: one posting seen on LinkedIn and on the
// employer board landing twice.
