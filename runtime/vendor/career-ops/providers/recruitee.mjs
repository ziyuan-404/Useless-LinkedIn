/**
 * Assemble a location string for one offer.
 *
 * Recruitee's flat `location` field carries only the offer's PRIMARY place
 * even when the offer is open in more than one: a live posting was observed
 * with `location: "Zürich, Zürich, Switzerland"` while its `locations`
 * array also carried a `"remote in Germany"` entry — so a `location_filter`
 * scoped to Germany never saw that the role was open there at all. `locations`
 * holds every place as `{ name, city, country, ... }`; when it lists 2+
 * DISTINCT names, those are joined instead of trusting the flat field —
 * counted after dedup, so an array that repeats the same place twice (e.g.
 * `[{name: "Berlin, Germany"}, {name: "Berlin, Germany"}]`) still falls
 * through to the flat-field path below rather than discarding a possibly
 * richer flat `location` string in favor of a "join" of one place. Each name
 * gets its `city` and `country` appended when present and not already part of
 * the name text — checked with `containsWholeWord`, not a substring check, so
 * "Zürich, Switzerland" + city "Zürich" + country "Switzerland" does not
 * become "Zürich, Switzerland, Zürich, Switzerland", and a name like
 * "Parisian HQ" still gets city "Paris" appended rather than being mistaken
 * for already naming it. Each field is checked and appended independently, so
 * a name missing only one of the two still gets exactly that one added.
 * Deduped, joined with " · " like ashby/eightfold/gem/workday's multi-place
 * handling, so scan.mjs's location_filter sees every place a multi-location
 * role is open to.
 *
 * Falls back to the single-place logic — explicit `location` (with the
 * top-level `country` appended when the location doesn't already name it),
 * else assembled from city/country, appending "Remote" when `remote` is true
 * — when `locations` yields 0 or 1 distinct names.
 *
 * The joined multi-place path also honors the top-level `remote` flag: it is
 * a separate signal from the named places (a "remote in Germany" entry names
 * a place AND implies remote, but "Berlin, Germany" + "Paris, France" with
 * `remote: true` implies a fully-remote role without either name saying so).
 * "Remote" is appended unless a distinct name already expresses it
 * (case-insensitive substring), so it is never duplicated.

/**
 * Parse a Recruitee /api/offers/ response. Exported for unit tests.
 *
 * Recruitee returns:
 *   { offers: [{ title, careers_url?, url?, city?, country?, remote?, location?, locations? }] }
 *
 * - url: tries `careers_url` first, falling back to `url` when `careers_url`
 *   is absent or invalid — each candidate validated independently, so one bad
 *   field never shadows an otherwise-usable other one. Recruitee tenants
 *   commonly serve postings on their own custom domain (e.g.
 *   `careers.hostaway.com`), so this URL is NOT host-locked to
 *   `*.recruitee.com`. Unlike the API endpoint, the per-offer URL is
 *   display-only — it is written to the pipeline and scan history but never
 *   server-fetched here, so the SSRF rationale does not apply. It is sourced
 *   from the already-validated tenant API response. Requirement: a
 *   well-formed `https:` URL; when neither candidate resolves, the whole
 *   offer is dropped (see Drop rule below).
 * - location: see `assembleLocation` — joins `locations[]` when it lists 2+
 *   distinct places (appending "Remote" when `remote` is true and no place
 *   name already says so), else the explicit `location` field plus `country`
 *   when it isn't already named there, else assembled
 *   from city/country, appending "Remote" when `remote` is true.
 * - description: Recruitee's list payload embeds each offer's full HTML body
 *   for free (same request — verified against a live board), so it is
 *   stripped to plain text here and feeds scan.mjs's content_filter /
 *   visa_filter. Omitted when the offer carries no usable body.
 * - a posting Recruitee itself marks "(Sample)" in the title is dropped
 *   entirely (see isRecruiteeSamplePosting, #4190), so a tenant serving only
 *   its seeded sample posting resolves as empty rather than as a live board.
 *
 * Drop rule: an offer with no usable `title`, or no resolvable absolute
 * `url`, is silently omitted, never emitted half-formed with `title: ''` or
 * `url: ''` — same convention as `parseIbmResponse` (`providers/ibm.mjs`) and
 * `parseEightfoldResponse` (`providers/eightfold.mjs`). The URL requirement
 * is load-bearing beyond the general "required field" convention: `url` is
 * this provider's own dedup key downstream (`scan.mjs`'s `normalizeUrlForDedup`
 * treats an empty string as a value like any other), so a second title-bearing,
 * URL-less offer from the same tenant would silently collapse onto the first
 * one in `seenUrls` and be dropped as a false duplicate — worse than omitting
 * both up front. A malformed entry (`null`, a primitive, anything that isn't a
 * plain object) is skipped the same way, rather than throwing and losing
 * every other offer in the response.
 *
 * @param {any} json
 * @param {string} companyName
 * @returns {Array<{title: string, url: string, company: string, location: string, description?: string}>}
