/**
 * _dns-cache.mjs — in-process DNS memoization for the scanners.
 *
 * Node's `fetch()` resolves the hostname once per *connection* it opens, and
 * keeps no DNS cache of its own. Sequential requests are cheap — undici's
 * keep-alive reuses the socket — but the sweeps run their requests in
 * parallel, and every concurrent connection resolves independently. Measured
 * against a local server (30 requests to one hostname):
 *
 *     sequential           2 lookups
 *     30 in parallel      29 lookups   <-- one per connection
 *
 * Scaled across a full directory sweep that reached ~37k lookups for a single
 * hostname in one run. On a host whose resolver rate-limits per client (a
 * Pi-hole's default is 1000/min) that trips the limit and breaks DNS for the
 * whole machine, not just the scan.
 *
 * Because the driver is concurrency rather than request count, coalescing
 * in-flight misses is the load-bearing part of this file — a plain TTL cache
 * would still let a cold parallel burst through. With both, the 29 above
 * becomes 1.
 *
 * Why patch `dns.lookup` rather than configure each HTTP client: providers
 * normally call the global `fetch()`. `net.connect` reads `dns.lookup` at call
 * time, so importing this file once (`_http.mjs` does) covers direct requests
 * without changing their dispatcher. Proxy opt-in uses an undici dispatcher
 * only for provider requests; direct and NO_PROXY requests still need this
 * cache and address guard.
 *
 * Scope of the patch — deliberately narrow:
 *   - Only the callback-style `dns.lookup` on the `node:dns` module object.
 *   - `dns/promises` has its own independent `lookup` and is NOT affected.
 *     That matters: the SSRF egress guard in `upskill.mjs` resolves through
 *     `dns/promises` (`dns.resolve` + `dns.promises.lookup`), so its
 *     validation still hits the resolver every time and cannot be poisoned
 *     by this cache. Verify with:
 *       node -e "const d=require('dns'),p=require('dns/promises');let n=0; \
 *         const r=d.lookup; d.lookup=(...a)=>{n++;return r(...a)}; \
 *         p.lookup('example.com').then(()=>console.log('promises hit patch:',n>0))"
 *   - Failed resolutions are never cached, so an outage cannot be pinned in.
 *
 * Two env knobs, both read at import time:
 *   - `CAREER_OPS_NO_DNS_CACHE=1` opts out entirely — no memoization AND no
 *     pacing, since both live inside this patched lookup.
 *   - `CAREER_OPS_DNS_LOOKUPS_PER_MIN` caps resolver-bound lookups
 *     (default 400; `0` disables pacing but keeps the cache).
