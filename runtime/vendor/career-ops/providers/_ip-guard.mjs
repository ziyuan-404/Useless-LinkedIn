// Reject a connection whose resolved address is not a public one (#3096).
//
// Every provider's host guard pins the HOSTNAME to a public registrable
// domain, but nothing checked where that name RESOLVES. A hostname with an A
// record pointing at 127.0.0.1, 169.254.169.254 (cloud metadata) or an RFC1918
// range was connected to normally. `redirect: 'error'` blocks redirect-based
// hops; it does not block a direct malicious record.
//
// WHY THE CHECK IS SCOPED, NOT GLOBAL. _dns-cache.mjs patches `dns.lookup` on
// the node:dns module object, which is process-wide. Rejecting private ranges
// there unconditionally would reject every loopback connection anything in the
// process makes — measured, Node calls dns.lookup even for a numeric host:
//
//     fetch('http://127.0.0.1:PORT')  -> dns.lookup calls: 1
//     fetch('http://localhost:PORT')  -> dns.lookup calls: 2
//
// In this repo that is already 10+ test files that stand up a local HTTP
// server and fetch it. An env opt-out would have fixed the suite by disabling
// the guard exactly where it is most likely to regress, so instead
// providers/_http.mjs marks its own requests with the AsyncLocalStorage below
// and the patched lookup validates only inside that context.
//
// WHY AT LOOKUP TIME. The address validated has to be the address dialled, or
// a name that answers public-then-private (DNS rebinding) slips through a
// pre-flight check. Direct `net.connect` reads `dns.lookup` at call time and
// connects to what it returns, so validating there closes that window.
// With explicit trusted-proxy opt-in, only the proxy's own DNS lookup is
// exempted. The proxy resolves the destination remotely, so its operator must
// enforce the same public-address rule there; see README proxy setup.
