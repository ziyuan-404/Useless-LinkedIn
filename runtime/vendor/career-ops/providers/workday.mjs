//
// This recovers coverage; it does not guarantee completeness. Real boards are

// (Brand 6562/6564, timeType 6483/6499), so the dominant mass never splits
// below the ceiling. The split is therefore strictly additive on top of the
// unfaceted crawl, and a board it could not finish keeps the workdayTruncated

 * Ago" (→ `undefined`). The detail document carries `jobPostingInfo.startDate`,
 * an absolute date — so a posting we already paid a GET for can be dated
 * exactly instead of approximately.
 *
 * Deliberately stricter than `Date.parse` alone: `Date.parse` falls back to an
 * implementation-defined parse for anything non-ISO, so a tenant emitting some
 * other date format could yield a plausible-looking timestamp on one Node build
 * and NaN on another. Measured on cvshealth/crowdstrike/nvidia, 11 of 11 detail
 * documents returned a bare `YYYY-MM-DD` and none carried a time — but 11 is a
 * small sample and three further tenants could not be measured (their list
 * endpoint answers HTTP 422), so anything that is not an ISO-8601 date is left
 * alone rather than guessed at. `postedAt` then keeps its `parsePostedOn`
 * value, which is the pre-existing behaviour.
 *
 * Note the granularity change this implies for a posting whose `postedOn` said
 * "Posted Today": `Date.now()` becomes that day's UTC midnight, i.e. slightly
 * EARLIER. That cannot cost a posting its place in a `--since` window —
 * `resolveEffectiveAfter` truncates the cutoff to a date and
 * `buildPostedDateFilter` parses it as UTC midnight too (scan.mjs), so both
 * sides of the comparison are day-aligned.
 *
 * A second direction applies to the "Posted 30+ Days Ago" bucket.
 * `parsePostedOn` returns `undefined` for that label, so without enrichment the
 * posting carries no `postedAt` and passes any age-based filter
 * ("don't penalize missing data"). Once `startDate` provides the real date, the
 * posting is accurately dated and a `max_posting_age_days: 30` window can now
 * legitimately exclude it. The "undated passes" rule is a fallback for
 * ignorance, not a policy of inclusion; once the real date is in hand the filter
 * decision is correct, not stricter.
